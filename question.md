# How Many of You Can Relate to This?

![why_we_do_this_gif](./assets/images/slide_images/why.gif.webp)

- A monolithic repo
- One gatekeeping team
- Hyper-specific resource names
- Enormous Terraform state files 


???

A monolithic repo to manage Vault. It's huge, unwieldy, and most likely you're managing resources across multiple different spaces

One team is responsible for responding to all developer requests for Vault assistance, from PRs to troubleshooting

Resource names are hyper specific to the point of being difficult to know what anything does

Your state files take 10 minutes to plan

What if you could change all of that? What if I said that there was a better solution?
