## What is a Namespace?

> A Vault Enterprise feature that enables organizations to create "mini-Vaults" inside their larger installation

> Provides tenant isolation and administrative delegation


Contains:
- Policies
- Auth methods
- Secret engines
- Tokens
- Identity entities and groups

???

Namespaces help companies like yours provide their developers with the ability to manage secrets in a self serving manner.

You can configure all of the items a namespace contains to distinct instances. 

Tokens are locked to a namespace; groups can pull in entites and groups from other namespaces
